# BruinSplit
With the expensive and rising costs of Uber/Lyft/Waymo rides, we wanted to design an app called BruinSplit which helps UCLA students find other students to split the cost of a ride somewhere. This app will let users log in with their UCLA email, post or join ride requests based on time and destination.
